## CHAPTER 2 : Perceptron
- receive multiple signal as input and output single signal
- If sum of input signal and weight is greater than threshold then output is 1, else 0 <br>
```
output = 1 (x1*w1 + x2*w2 + ... + xn*wn > θ)
         0 (x1*w1 + x2*w2 + ... + xn*wn <= θ)
```
- Single-layer perceptron can implement AND, NAND, OR but cannot implement XOR
 > Multi-layer perceptron make XOR possible
- Theoretically, Double-layer perceptron makes computer
